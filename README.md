## Case Study

Design patterns are beneficial for various reasons. They are proven solutions that industry veterans have tried and tested. They are solid approaches that solve issues in a widely accepted way and reflect the experience and insights of the industry-leading developers that helped define them. Patterns also make your code more reusable and readable while speeding up the development process vastly.

### Creational Design Patterns

As the name suggests, these patterns are for handling object creational mechanisms. A creational design pattern basically solves a problem by controlling the creation process of an object.

- [x] [**_Constructor Pattern_**](https://github.com/firhatsungkar/cdc-javascript-design-patterns/tree/master/Constructor%20Pattern)
- [x] [**_Factory Pattern_**](https://github.com/firhatsungkar/cdc-javascript-design-patterns/tree/master/Factory%20Pattern)
- [x]  [**_Prototype Pattern_**](https://github.com/firhatsungkar/cdc-javascript-design-patterns/tree/master/Prototype%20Pattern)
- [x]  [**_Singleton Pattern_**](https://github.com/firhatsungkar/cdc-javascript-design-patterns/tree/master/Singleton%20Pattern)

### Structural Design Patterns

These patterns are concerned with class and object composition. They help structure or restructure one or more parts without affecting the entire system. In other words, they help obtain new functionalities without tampering with the existing ones.

- [ ] **_Adapter Pattern_**
- [ ] **_Composite Pattern_**
- [ ] **_Decorator Pattern_**
- [ ] **_Fa√ßade Pattern_**
- [ ] **_Flyweight Pattern_**
- [ ] **_Proxy Pattern_**


### Behavioral Design Patterns

These patterns are concerned with improving communication between dissimilar objects.

- [ ] **_Chain of Responsibility Pattern_**
- [ ] **_Command Pattern_**
- [ ] **_Iterator Pattern_**
- [ ] **_Mediator Pattern_**
- [ ] **_Observer Pattern_**
- [ ] **_State Pattern_**
- [ ] **_Strategy Pattern_**
- [ ] **_Template Pattern_**
