# Singleton Pattern

Singleton is a special creational design pattern in which only one instance of a class can exist. It works like this â€” if no instance of the singleton class exists then a new instance is created and returned, but if an instance already exists, then the reference to the existing instance is returned.
A perfect real-life example would be that of `mongoose` (the famous Node.js ODM library for MongoDB). It utilizes the singleton pattern.
