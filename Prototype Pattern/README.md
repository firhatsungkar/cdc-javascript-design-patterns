# Prototype Pattern

This pattern is an object-based creational design pattern. In this, we use a sort of a “skeleton” of an existing object to create or instantiate new objects.
This pattern is specifically important and beneficial to JavaScript because it utilizes prototypal inheritance instead of a classic object-oriented inheritance. Hence, it plays to JavaScript’s strength and has native support.
